        The Himalayan ibex, also known as the Siberian ibex or the Altai ibex,
        is a species of wild goat found in the mountainous regions of Central
        and South Asia. It is a large mammal, with males standing up to 90 cm
        (35 in) at the shoulder and weighing up to 100 kg (220 lb), while
        females are slightly smaller. The Himalayan ibex has a distinctive
        appearance, with a long, shaggy coat that is dark brown in color, with a
        pale belly and rump. Both males and females have long, curved horns that
        can reach up to 120 cm (47 in) in length in males and 40 cm (16 in) in
        females. The Himalayan ibex is a social animal, living in herds of up to
        100 individuals. They are herbivores, and their diet consists mainly of
        grasses, leaves, and shrubs. They are also known to be very agile
        climbers, and they can often be seen scaling steep cliffs and rocky
        slopes with ease. The Himalayan ibex is an important species in the
        mountain ecosystems of Central and South Asia. They play a role in
        controlling the vegetation, and they are also a source of food and fur
        for local people. However, the Himalayan ibex is also a threatened
        species, due to habitat loss, hunting, and competition from domestic
        livestock. Conservation efforts are underway to protect the Himalayan
        ibex and ensure its survival in the wild
